You can control RIVER Pro using your phone. Just link to it in the EcoFlow app to control it from afar. ","Yes. RIVER Pro can power devices up to 1800W with our proprietary technology, X-Boost.  *X-Boost can run devices that require up to 1800W, however, it’s best to test before use. Some 600W–1800W appliances with strict voltage requirements may not function (e.g. air compressors). ","Yes. You can connect up to 2 sets of 110W solar panels to sustainably charge your RIVER Pro in under 3 hours.","It can be an emergency power source (EPS), which will have the same result as UPS for most electronics. Here's the difference.  When your RIVER Pro is plugged into the wall, anything plugged into it gets power from the grid, not its battery. If power from the grid stops, RIVER Pro automatically switches to its battery supply mode within 30 milliseconds. That means anything connected will not have power for 30 milliseconds, which may mean sensitive electronics like desktop computers and data servers turn off. Test your devices individually to see if they need UPS to stay powered.","You can only connect one RIVER Pro Extra Battery to one RIVER Pro. The Extra Battery for RIVER is a different product.","Store the Extra Battery at room temperature and in a dry place. If you plan to store it long term, charge it to 30–50%, turn off the main switch, and store it at room temperature."],"i":2},{"_name":"Product Spec","_template":"product-spec","_zone":"ecoflow-river","_icon":"","section_id":"kcnlbbdlns","atb_enable_checkbox":"true","atb_title":"Specs","blocks[]":["vqjvjfhggd","ldtqlmhcia","yqumrqfuvr","gcahxibxba","qmbrzpwbny","qdvzgobevr","dpfcseocdr","dpfcseocdr","oameyeyvlg","oameyeyvlg","errxjjzucc","sdvmvqcqqt","yucnyqiohz","uwrxlgpjck","mjdzrtyzyw","wyyyjcoboz","lapniiqvtw","hirtcrsmla","sghcqkydml","ftvrlvexyq","btauxloqiz","ztpfofmels","fihyhciqeu","cwcftoyziz","grypnbxofm"],"block_spec_name[]":["Net Weight","Dimensions","Charge Temperature","Discharge Temperature","Warranty","Charging Method","Capacity","Capacity (with extra battery)","Full Recharge Time (RIVER Pro)","Full Recharge Time (with Extra Battery)","Cell Chemistry","Shelf Life","Cycle Life","Management Systems","AC Charge Input Power","AC Charge Input Voltage","Solar Charge Input","Car Charger","AC Output (x3)","USB-A Output (x2)","USB-A Fast Charge (x1)","USB-C Output (x1)","Car Power Output (x1) ","DC5521 Output (x2)","Testing and Certifications"],"block_spec_detail[]":["16.8 lbs (7.6kg)","11.4 x 7.1 x 9.3in (28.9 x 18.0 x 23.5cm) ","32 to 113°F +/- 5°F (0 to 45°C +/- 3°C)","-4 to 113°F +/- 5°F (-20 to 45°C +/- 3°C) ","24 months","AC Wall Outlet, 12V Car Adapter, Solar Panel(s)","720Wh","1440Wh","1.6 Hours (AC) 8 Hours (12V Car Charger)</br> 9-18 Hours (Using 1x 110W Solar Panel)</br> 4-8 Hours (Using 2x 110W Solar Panels, in parallel)</br> 6-12 Hours (Using 1x 160W Solar Panel)</br></br>","3 Hours (AC) 16 Hours (12V Car Charger)</br> 18-36 Hours (Using 1x 110W Solar Panel)</br> 8-16 Hours (Using 2x 110W Solar Panels, in parallel)</br> 12-24 Hours (Using 1x 160W Solar Panel)","Lithium-ion","1 year (once fully charged)","800 cycles to 80%+ capacity</br></br></br></br>","BMS, Over Voltage Protection, Overload Protection,  Over Temperature Protection, Short Circuit Protection                                                        Low Temperature Protection, Low Voltage Protection,    Overcurrent Protection","X-Stream Charge 660W Max","220-240Vac (50Hz/60Hz) ","200W 10-25Vdc 12A Max","12Vdc 8A Max","600W (Surge 1200W) total, 230Vac (50Hz/60Hz) ","5Vdc, 2.4A, 12W Max per port","5V/2.4A,9V/2A,12V/1.5A  18W Max","5Vdc, 9Vdc, 12Vdc, 15Vdc, 20Vdc, 5A, 100W Max","136W, 13.6Vdc, 10A Max","13.6Vdc, 3A Max per port","UL Standard, CE, FCC, RoHS, RCM"]}]
