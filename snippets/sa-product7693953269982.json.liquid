That'll give you days of power for your essential appliances. ","DELTA Pro's Smart Extra Battery benefits from all the charging methods DELTA Pro has, including 6500W MultiCharge. That means you can charge anytime, anywhere as long as your extra battery is connected to DELTA Pro. Once connected, they'll charge/discharge in unison, keeping the battery percent level across both units.","When the going gets tough and you're out of charge options, get a 1800W DC fast charge with EcoFlow Smart Generator (sold separately). Just plug the generator directly into your extra battery via the port on the back. This works even when disconnected from your DELTA Pro.","The Smart Extra Battery sports a bright LCD screen on the front of the unit giving you all the info you need. Output, input, remaining charge and time remaining. It's all there. Need on the go info? The EcoFlow app can tell you all that & a whole lot more."],"block_background_image[]":["https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/EcoFlow_DELTA_Pro_Smart_Extra_Battery_scene_EU_1_PC.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_EB_2_Mobile_1800x_aa6e63aa-e15a-4fd0-bea6-f3a41b524758.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_EB_3_PC_1800x_6bbef4ab-4daa-46c8-9fed-25ce986d73de.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_EB_4_PC_1800x_32e11bb7-c7b0-466f-bfd7-6be06b2ffa42.jpg"],"block_background_image_mobile[]":["https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/EcoFlow_DELTA_Pro_Smart_Extra_Battery_scene_EU_1_Mobile.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_EB_2_PC_1200x_bf518eeb-4ada-4431-9acb-2be8d451eb42.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_EB_3_Mobile_1200x_59fb1519-78c6-485e-b126-a2a2558e4974.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_EB_4_Mobile_1200x_1df91a79-8536-4445-bb8d-67e11eb1de37.jpg"],"i":0},{"_name":"Product Box","_template":"product-box","_zone":"ecoflow-river","_icon":"","section_id":"wnxejshzjk","atb_enable_checkbox":"true","atb_title":"Contenido","atb_background_image":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_PRO_EB_product_box_PC_2400x_e03fbf00-7de0-46d4-848d-ee74a94cdd6f.jpg","atb_background_image_mobile":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_PRO_EB-product_box_mobile_1200x_3c771fdd-0b9b-4b8d-b33a-a8f4d26a1e19.jpg","atb_description":"1.DELTA Pro Smart Extra Battery 2.DELTA Pro Extra Battery Cable 3.Handle Cover 4.User Manual","i":1},{"_name":"Product FAQ","_template":"product-faq","_zone":"ecoflow-river","_icon":"","section_id":"ckxbrneztq","atb_enable_checkbox":"true","atb_title":"Preguntas frecuentes","blocks[]":["zfvjbysaag","hctmswggra","gtvetmfpao","huejjygycl"],"block_question[]":["How many extra batteries can I use with DELTA Pro?","What makes the Smart Extra Battery \"Smart\"?","Can I charge the extra battery independently of DELTA Pro ?","How fast does the Smart Extra Battery charge?"],"block_answer[]":["For each DELTA Pro unit, you can link an extra two batteries, bringing you up to 10.8kWh of capacity.
