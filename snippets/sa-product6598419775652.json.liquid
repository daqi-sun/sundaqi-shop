RIVER is ideal for lightweight, grab-and-go power, which you can expand with the extra battery. RIVER Max includes the extra battery by default, which you can remove to go lightweight. RIVER Pro is made for those that need even more capacity for off-grid, long haul adventures.","Yes. RIVER can power devices up to 1200W with our proprietary technology, X-Boost.  *X-Boost can run devices that require up to 1200W, however, it’s best to test before use. Some 600W-1200W appliances with strict voltage requirements may not function (eg. air compressors).","Yes. You can control RIVER using your phone. Just connect to the EcoFlow app to control from afar. Here’s how:  Step 1: Make sure the EcoFlow App is connected to RIVER.  Step 2: Make sure RIVER is on. Step 3: Make sure your device’s WiFi is turned on Step 4: Find your device in the app. Then, you can start controlling your RIVER remotely. ","RIVER supports entry-level UPS functionality. Make sure to perform multiple tests to confirm compatibility before connecting devices such as data servers and workstations with RIVER.","Increase the efficiency of your solar panel by facing it directly at the sun without any obstructions. Remember to be careful when handling your solar panel because damaged cells provide less power. "," Yes, if the only thing between it and the sun is transparent, but it won’t charge as well compared to being outside. You can compare the difference by looking at the input section of your power station’s LCD screen."],"i":3},{"_name":"Product Box","_template":"product-box","_zone":"ecoflow-river","_icon":"","section_id":"evgdsdpokp","atb_enable_checkbox":"true","atb_title":"What's in the bundle (RIVER)","atb_background_image":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/RIVER_Pro_PC_what_s_in_the_box.jpg","atb_background_image_mobile":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/RIVER_Pro_Mobile_what_s_in_the_box.jpg","atb_description":"1.
