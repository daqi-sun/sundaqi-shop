You can control RIVER Pro using your phone. Just link to it in the EcoFlow app to control it from afar. ","Yes. RIVER Pro can power devices up to 1800W with our proprietary technology, X-Boost.  *X-Boost can run devices that require up to 1800W, however, it’s best to test before use. Some 600W–1800W appliances with strict voltage requirements may not function (e.g. air compressors). ","It can be an emergency power source (EPS), which will have the same result as UPS for most electronics. Here's the difference.  When your RIVER Pro is plugged into the wall, anything plugged into it gets power from the grid, not its battery. If power from the grid stops, RIVER Pro automatically switches to its battery supply mode within 30 milliseconds. That means anything connected will not have power for 30 milliseconds, which may mean sensitive electronics like desktop computers and data servers turn off. Test your devices individually to see if they need UPS to stay powered.","Increase the efficiency of your solar panel by facing it directly at the sun without any obstructions. Remember to be careful when handling your solar panel because damaged cells provide less power. ","Yes, if the only thing between it and the sun is transparent, but it won’t charge as well compared to being outside. You can compare the difference by looking at the input section of your power station’s LCD screen."],"i":2},{"_name":"Product Box","_template":"product-box","_zone":"ecoflow-river","_icon":"","section_id":"xygcksuwcq","atb_enable_checkbox":"true","atb_title":"What's in the bundle (RIVER Pro)","atb_background_image":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/RIVER_Pro_PC_what_s_in_the_box.jpg","atb_background_image_mobile":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/RIVER_Pro_Mobile_what_s_in_the_box.jpg","atb_description":"1.
