This means when a blackout hits, you can continue to power your important home devices such as your fridge and lights for hours on end.","DELTA Max charges up safely and rapidly from 0-80% in just 1 hour. And it gets even better. If you're looking for an even faster way to charge up DELTA Max, you can combine AC with the Smart Generator, AC with solar, or the Smart Generator with solar.","With EcoFlow's X-Boost technology, DELTA Max can power heavy-duty devices up to 3000W. That means during a power outage or blackout, you can continue to power your fridge, dryer, and more. That's the industry gold standard for a portable power station of this size and capacity.","DELTA Max connects with up to 2x 400W EcoFlow solar panels to deliver 800W Max solar charging speeds. With a voltage range from 11-100V and the solar connector, you can also connect other solar panels to your DELTA Max. Even during cold or cloudy days, our smart maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm automatically detects voltage and current in real time to give you optimum solar generation throughout the day.","Disasters can occur at any time of the year, sometimes lasting longer than we ever expected. When extended blackouts hit, the EcoFlow Smart Generator serves as an emergency option that integrates with DELTA Max. It auto-starts when your DELTA Max hits a low level of charge, recharges your DELTA Max, and stops the engine all by itself once your DELTA Max hits a full charge. This gives you a reliable emergency backup option that relies on minimum use of a generator.","Control and monitor your DELTA Max with the EcoFlow app. Dive into the settings to customize your power use or control DELTA Max

For DELTA Max single unit, you can recharge it at standard wall outlets (1800W max), or combine AC and solar charging to reach max 2000W charging speeds.","When your portable power station is plugged into the wall, any electronics plugged into it are powered from the grid and not its battery. When power from the grid stops, as in a blackout, the power station automatically switches to battery power within 30ms.","DELTA Max is not water-resistant, so it should be kept away from liquids. Or if you're looking for water-resistance solution, you can purchase the DELTA Max case to water-resistance protection."],"i":10},{"_name":"Product Spec","_template":"product-spec","_zone":"ecoflow-river","_icon":"","section_id":"wjivnomcxi","atb_enable_checkbox":"true","atb_title":"Specs of DELTA Max (2000)","blocks[]":["ryvuiaoprz","ujqmhxjwan","jdxhqtlaij","oppxvhnxud","gywgnyhusr","csfrhzrgzl","clvdmvgvwh","srhonglanf","ytpjacbwks","vcmiwbcmcy","kelvznjgip","puvrhmiecz","tjezacwtvw","lvhvwksbng","lhjwuzhqsf","phbyuzdspa","lpcvofjpep","lpcvofjpep","ggfdqzixug","geyageeery","dlbhwogssz","ebendfwkml","lyzqvibkzm","qfkrtlqjtc","eqkphxbevx","yqizrbkrdl"],"block_spec_name[]":["Net Weight","Dimension","Charge Temperature","Discharge Temperature","Warranty","Charge Method","Full Recharge Time","Capacity","Cell Chemistry","Cycle life","Management Systems","Testing and Certification","AC Charge Input (Power)","AC Charge Input (Voltage and Amperage)","Solar Charge Input","Car Charge Input","AC Output (x4)","Max Device(s) Power Supported by X-Boost","USB-A Output (x2)","USB-A Fast Charge (x2)","USB-C Output (x2)","Car Charger Output (x1)","DC5521 Output (x2)","Smart Extra Battery","Smart Generator","Wi-Fi"],"block_spec_detail[]":["Approx. 48 lbs (22 kg)","19.6 x 9.5 x 12 in (49.7 x 24.2 x 30.5 cm)","32 to 113°F (0 to 45°C)","-4 to 113°F (-20 to 45°C)","24 months","AC Wall Outlet, 12V Car Adaptor, Solar Panel, Smart Generator, Smart Extra Battery","1.6 Hours (AC) 21 Hours (12V Car Charger) 5.6-11.2 Hours (Using 4x 110W Solar Panels) 4.2-8.4 Hours (Using 4x 160W Solar Panels) 3.2-6.3 Hours (Using 2x 400W Solar Panels)","2016Wh","NCM","800 cycles to 80%+ capacity","BMS, Over Voltage Protection, Overload Protection, Over Temperature Protection, Short Circuit Protection, Low Temperature Protection, Low Voltage Protection, Overcurrent Protection","CE WEEE CTP RCM KC","X-Stream charge (2000W max)","220-240V~50Hz/60Hz, 10A","11-100V 13A Max, 800W max","Supports 12V/24V Battery, Default 8A","Pure Sine Wave, 2400W total (surge 4600W), 230V~ (50Hz/60Hz)","3000W","5V 2.4A, 12W max, per port","5V/2.4A, 9V/2A, 12V/1.5A, 18W Max","5/9/12/15/20V 5A, 100W max","12.6V/10A, 126W max","12.6V/3A, per port","Supports up to 2 DELTA Max Smart Extra Batteries (sold separately)","Supported (sold separately)","Supported"],"i":11},{"_name":"Product Spec copy","_template":"product-spec","_zone":"ecoflow-river","_icon":"","section_id":"vjlsxtegpa","atb_enable_checkbox":"true","atb_title":"Specs of DELTA Max (1600)","blocks[]":["ryvuiaoprz","ujqmhxjwan","jdxhqtlaij","oppxvhnxud","gywgnyhusr","csfrhzrgzl","clvdmvgvwh","srhonglanf","ytpjacbwks","vcmiwbcmcy","kelvznjgip","puvrhmiecz","tjezacwtvw","lvhvwksbng","lhjwuzhqsf","phbyuzdspa","lpcvofjpep","lpcvofjpep","ggfdqzixug","geyageeery","dlbhwogssz","ebendfwkml","lyzqvibkzm","qfkrtlqjtc","eqkphxbevx","yqizrbkrdl"],"block_spec_name[]":["Net Weight","Dimension","Charge Temperature","Discharge Temperature","Warranty","Charge Method","Full Recharge Time","Capacity","Cell Chemistry","Cycle life","Management Systems","Testing and Certification","AC Charge Input (Power)","AC Charge Input (Voltage and Amperage)","Solar Charge Input","Car Charge Input","AC Output (x4)","Max Device(s) Power Supported by X-Boost","USB-A Output (x2)","USB-A Fast Charge (x2)","USB-C Output (x2)","Car Charger Output (x1)","DC5521 Output (x2)","Smart Extra Battery","Smart Generator","Wi-Fi"],"block_spec_detail[]":["Approx. 48 lbs (22 kg)","19.6 x 9.5 x 12 in (49.7 x 24.2 x 30.5 cm)","32 to 113°F (0 to 45°C)","-4 to 113°F (-20 to 45°C)","24 months","AC Wall Outlet, 12V Car Adaptor, Solar Panel, Smart Generator, Smart Extra Battery","1.6 Hours (AC) 16.8 Hours (12V Car Charger) 4.5-9 Hours (Using 4x 110W Solar Panels) 3.4-6.8 Hours (Using 4x 160W Solar Panels) 2.5-5 Hours (Using 2x 400W Solar Panels)","1612Wh","NCM","500 Cycles to 80%+ capacity","BMS, Over Voltage Protection, Overload Protection, Over Temperature Protection, Short Circuit Protection, Low Temperature Protection, Low Voltage Protection, Overcurrent Protection","CE WEEE CTP RCM KC","X-Stream charge (1600W max)","220-240V~50Hz/60Hz, 10A","11-100V 13A Max, 800W max","Supports 12V/24V Battery, Default 8A","Pure Sine Wave, 2000W total (surge 4600W), 230V~ (50Hz/60Hz)","2500W","5V 2.4A, 12W max, per port","5V/2.4A, 9V/2A, 12V/1.5A, 18W Max","5/9/12/15/20V 5A, 100W max","12.6V/10A, 126W max","12.6V/3A, per port","Supports up to 2 DELTA Max Smart Extra Batteries (sold separately)","Supported (sold separately)","Supported"],"i":12},{"_name":"Product Additional Spec","_template":"product-additional-spec","_zone":"ecoflow-river","_icon":"","section_id":"prwuyenqhz","atb_enable_checkbox":"true","atb_inatallment_plan":"<p>*Please Note: The above weight, size, etc. have certain measurement errors.
