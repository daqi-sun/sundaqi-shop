With that, you're covered for any situation. That's the industry gold standard.","A single DELTA Pro unit packs a 3600W AC output, which can be expanded up to 4500W with X-Boost technology. Power 99.99% heavy-duty devices at home, outdoors, or at work. You can even pair two units together to achieve 7200W with Smart Home Panel.","MultiCharge delivers record-breaking speeds at 6500W. To reach 6500W, you can opt for these charging methods.","EcoFlow’s X-Stream charging technology isn't just fast, it's safe too. The battery management system ensures safety and longevity while you fully charge DELTA Pro from a standard AC wall outlet in 1.9 hours*.","For the first time ever with a portable power station, you can charge up at thousands of EV stations worldwide. This unique charging method gives you up to 3400W fast charging on the go.","EcoFlow's suite of solar products give you a cost-effective renewable energy source to stay powered. You can use solar energy to charge DELTA Pro in just 2.8-5.6 hours. DELTA Pro has a wide voltage range from 11-150V, which makes it compatible with 90% of third-party solar panels with solar connectors. And when the weather gets unpredictable, the smart maximum power point tracking (MPPT) automatically adjusts, maximizing your solar generation at any time of the day.","The EcoFlow Smart Generator serves as an emergency option that integrates with your DELTA Pro ecosystem. It auto-starts when your DELTA Pro hits a low level of charge, re-charges your DELTA Pro, and stops the engine all by itself once your DELTA Pro hits a full charge. Compared to a traditional gas generator, the EcoFlow Smart Generator delivers less energy loss, faster charging and higher efficiency.","DELTA Pro sports a brand-new LFP battery with 6500 cycles, which means you can use DELTA Pro for years and years before your unit reaches 50% of the original capacity. EcoFlow’s battery management system provides real-time analysis and regulation of voltage, current, and temperature. This unique protection mechanism makes DELTA Pro an incredibly safe and efficient home battery.","Control DELTA Pro either on the unit itself, using the remote control accessory, or unlock a ton of customization via the EcoFlow app. On the app, you can access your power settings, such as charging and discharging levels, AC charge speeds, control the Smart Generator and a whole lot more.","DELTA Pro's expandable ecosystem provides you with power during blackouts, customizable energy around the clock, and lower energy bills. How does it achieve all this? With a selection of extra batteries, smart generators, solar trackers, wind turbines, a smart home panel, and more. From backup power to reducing your reliance on the grid with green alternatives, the DELTA Pro ecosystem can be customized to your needs.","The new EcoFlow Smart Home Panel is the heart of the DELTA Pro home battery ecosystem. It integrates up to two DELTA Pro units with 10 home circuits. Each DELTA Pro can be connected with extra batteries, solar panels, or smart generators, giving you uninterrupted power during blackouts, smart energy management for your critical loads, and lower energy bills.","With a fast 20ms switchover time, DELTA Pro and the Smart Home Panel can keep you powered on during a blackout. All the while, the EcoFlow app keeps you in the know, letting you select and modify your device priorities.","The EcoFlow DELTA Pro ecosystem stores energy day and night, reducing your reliance on the grid and lowering your energy bills by combating time-of-use rates. It integrates directly with your home using the EcoFlow Smart Home Panel. The EcoFlow app gives you a smart breakdown of your energy habits, and you can customize your energy usage for any type of situation.","With DELTA Pro, you can take home with you, wherever you go. It features wheels and a suitcase-esque extendable handle that makes transport easy. And if you’re looking for a complete power solution for RV road trips and outdoor adventures, DELTA Pro comes with a 30A Anderson port and AC outlets.","Not only does DELTA Pro provide home backup and off-grid power, it also gives you a secure power source for any type of professional work. Whether you’re working at home or outdoors, from DIY to professional projects, DELTA Pro helps you get the job done."],"block_background_image[]":["https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_PC_-_1_EU.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_PC_-_2_EU.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_PC_-_3_EU.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_PC_-_4.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_PC_-_5_EU.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_PC_-_6.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_PC_-_7.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_PC_-_8.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_PC_-_9.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_PC_-_10.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_PC_-_11_EU.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_PC_-_12.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_PC_-_13.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_PC_-_14.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_PC_-_15.jpg"],"block_background_image_mobile[]":["https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_Mobile_-_1_EU.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_Mobile_-_2_EU.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_Mobile_-_3_EU.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_Mobile_-_4.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_Mobile_-_5_EU.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_Mobile_-_6.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_Mobile_-_7.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_Mobile_-_8.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_Mobile_-_9.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_Mobile_-_10.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_Mobile_-_11_EU.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_Mobile_-_12.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_Mobile_-_13.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_Mobile_-_14.jpg","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_Intro_Mobile_-_15.jpg"]},{"_name":"Product Box","_template":"product-box","_zone":"ecoflow-river","_icon":"","section_id":"zhngaewocr","atb_enable_checkbox":"true","atb_title":"What's in the box","atb_background_image":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_box_PC_-_EU_2400x_9b418543-cd3b-49d9-b9d7-f9a663d1665a.png","atb_background_image_mobile":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0431/3789/2516/files/DELTA_Pro_Product_box_Mobil_-_EU_2400x_eec1beca-c32f-46bc-9181-2cbe0d50561b.png","atb_description":"1.DELTA Pro 2.AC Charging Cable 3.Car Charging Cable 4.DC5521 to DC5525 cable 5.Handle Cover 6.User Manual","i":4},{"_name":"Product FAQ","_template":"product-faq","_zone":"ecoflow-river","_icon":"","section_id":"tpubnyofge","atb_enable_checkbox":"true","atb_title":"Frequently Asked Questions","blocks[]":["hxzqwixdaa","kvothejgco","wuzkedfcli"],"block_question[]":["What’s the max input DELTA Pro can achieve?","How many solar panels can I use at the same time?","How do I update the firmware?"],"block_answer[]":["When charging DELTA Pro and its extra battery together, you can reach 6500W max charging speeds by combining AC, solar and Smart Generator methods.
