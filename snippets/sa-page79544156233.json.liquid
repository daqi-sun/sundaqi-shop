Here’s how:  Step 1: Make sure the EcoFlow App is connected to RIVER Pro.  Step 2: Make sure RIVER Pro is on. Step 3: Make sure your device’s WiFi is turned on Step 4: Find your device in the app. Then, you can start controlling your RIVER Pro remotely. ","Yes. RIVER Pro can power devices up to 1200W with our proprietary technology, X-Boost.  *X-Boost can run devices that require up to 1200W, however, it’s best to test before use.
