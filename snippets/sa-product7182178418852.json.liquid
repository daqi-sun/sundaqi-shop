EcoFlow 400W portable solar panels have a larger wattage than typical solar panels and are more efficient due to their monocrystalline cells. Additionally, EcoFlow portable power stations use an MPPT algorithm that ensures a constant energy supply. Unlike static solar panels, portable solar panels are easily moved and adjusted depending on where the sun is in the sky.","Positioning portable solar panels at an angle between 30-45 degrees, facing the direction of the sun, is best. EcoFlow portable solar panels have a built-in stand that can be adjusted, depending on where the sun is in the sky.
