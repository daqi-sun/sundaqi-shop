RIVER is ideal for lightweight, grab-and-go power, which you can expand with the extra battery. RIVER Max includes the extra battery by default, which you can remove to go lightweight. RIVER Pro is made for those that need even more capacity for off-grid, long haul adventures.","Yes. RIVER can power devices up to 1200W with our proprietary technology, X-Boost.  *X-Boost can run devices that require up to 1200W, however, it’s best to test before use. Some 600W-1200W appliances with strict voltage requirements may not function (eg. air compressors).","Yes. You can control RIVER using your phone. Just connect to the EcoFlow app to control from afar. Here’s how:  Step 1: Make sure the EcoFlow App is connected to RIVER.  Step 2: Make sure RIVER is on. Step 3: Make sure your device’s WiFi is turned on Step 4: Find your device in the app. Then, you can start controlling your RIVER remotely. ","Yes. You can connect up to 2 sets of 110W solar panels to sustainably charge your RIVER in under 3 hours.","RIVER supports entry-level UPS functionality. Make sure to perform multiple tests to confirm compatibility before connecting devices such as data servers and workstations with RIVER."],"i":1},{"_name":"Product Spec","_template":"product-spec","_zone":"ecoflow-river","_icon":"","section_id":"pkpxfysnxc","atb_enable_checkbox":"on","atb_title":"Specs","blocks[]":["vgentrbcbk","hizktgslen","ntephvnpil","iqkyjitjvg","whrwxrfhwi","oxrepmjhgg","bdqrmfyabh","rjqwauhooj","oimmpilrel","tuoioebtav","ongjoikhkg","gufhtwfuoi","twlphmzfnp","hfgvadtqeh","hscvcfeaur","jdejhzkkhy","mnjprorpcf","xdhgfhdsyc","sjtwppqcbj","mkebejzmto","gqdjailmom","dyqopjpwyb","jyuxrtqdww"],"block_spec_name[]":["Net Weight *","Dimension *","Charge Temperature","Discharge Temperature","Color ","Warranty","Charge Method","Full Recharge Time","Capacity","Cell Chemistry","Cycle Life","Management Systems","Testing and certification","AC Charge Input Power","AC Charge Input Voltage","Solar Charge Input","Car Charger","AC Output (x2)","USB-A Output (x2)","USB-A Fast Charge (x1)","USB-C Output (x1)","Car Power Output (x1) ","DC5521 Output (x2)"],"block_spec_detail[]":["11 lbs (5kg)","11.3 x 7.3 x 7.7 in (28.8 x 18.5 x 19.4 cm)","32 to 113°F ± 5°F (0 to 45°C ± 3°C)","-4 to 113°F ± 5°F (-20 to 45°C ± 3°C)","Black ","24 months","AC Wall Outlet, 12V Car Adaptor, Solar Panel ","1.6 Hours (AC) 3 Hours (12V Car Adaptor) 1.6-3 Hours (Using 2x110W Solar Panels simultaneously with full sun)  2.4-4.8 Hours (Using 1x160W Solar Panel with full sun)","288Wh - 576Wh (With RIVER Extra Battery)","Lithium-ion","500 Cycles to 80%+ capacity","BMS, Over Voltage Protection, Overload Protection,  Over Temperature Protection, Short Circuit Protection, Low Temperature Protection, Low Voltage Protection, Overcurrent Protection","UL Standard CE FCC RoHS RCM","X-Stream Charge 250W max/500W Max (With RIVER Extra Battery)","220-240Vac(50Hz/60Hz)                                 ","200W 10-25V DC 12A max","12V DC 8A max","600W (Surge 1200W) total, 230Vac (50Hz/60Hz) ","5V DC,2.4A,12W Max, per port","5V/2.4A,9V/2A,12V/1.5A 18W Max","5V DC,9V DC,12V DC,15V DC,20V DC,5A,100W Max","136W, 13.6V DC, 10A Max","13.6V DC, 3A Max, per port"]},{"_name":"Product Additional Spec","_template":"product-additional-spec","_zone":"ecoflow-river","_icon":"","section_id":"qlrbhxcaau","atb_enable_checkbox":"true","atb_inatallment_plan":"<p>*Please Note: The above weight, size, etc. have certain measurement errors.
