As long as the solar panels use MC4 connector and its voltage and current are under 11-100V, 10A max range.","When charging DELTA Max and its extra battery together, you can reach 3600W max charging speeds by combining any two methods of AC, solar and Smart Generator. For DELTA Max single unit, you can recharge it at standard wall outlets (1800W max), or combine AC and solar charging to reach max 2000W charging speeds.","When your portable power station is plugged into the wall, any electronics plugged into it are powered from the grid and not its battery. When power from the grid stops, as in a blackout, the power station automatically switches to battery power within 30ms.","DELTA Max is not water-resistant, so it should be kept away from liquids. Or if you're looking for water-resistance solution, you can purchase the DELTA Max case to water-resistance protection.","Increase the efficiency of your solar panel by facing it directly at the sun without any obstructions. Remember to be careful when handling your solar panel because damaged cells provide less power.","Yes, if the only thing between it and the sun is transparent, but it won't charge as well compared to being outside.
