An on-grid — or tied — system is. With an on-grid system, your solar system diverts any excess power you generate to the utility grid. You may receive energy credits for this excess energy through a net metering program, but you don’t get to store off-grid energy in reserve. An off-grid system lets you use the energy you have generated, with any excess stored in your <a href=\"https:\/\/us.ecoflow.com\/pages\/solar-generators\">solar generator<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/us.ecoflow.com\/pages\/portable-power-stations\">portable power station<\/a>."}},"d1d0e880-a0c3-4866-967c-61315a5ffa1e":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"How Do You Build an Off-Grid Solar System?","answer":"By assembling all the required components!

If you used a <a href=\"https:\/\/us.ecoflow.com\/products\/400w-portable-solar-panel\">400W solar panel<\/a> and received 6 hours of direct sunlight per day, you’d generate approximately 2.4kWh per panel per day.

A solar system is more than panels—it requires a balance of system, and every component adds to the price. Your energy consumption also matters, with the cost typically increasing in proportion to the capacity. Finally, any labor required for installation adds to the system cost. You can reduce costs by installing a Power Kits system, which has all the components needed for off-grid solar and allows for easy DIY installation."}},"172bb076-2f58-465c-a8c8-45456ea06939":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"How Many Batteries Do You Need for an Off-Grid Solar System?","answer":"Solar panels need to store the energy they create somewhere. Storage takes place in solar batteries or a portable power station. A single battery should suffice if you want a backup for personal devices and essential appliances when the grid goes down. However, if you want to go off-grid entirely, you could need as many as twelve solar batteries (or more, depending on capacity) to ensure you have enough power to keep you going. The right number ultimately depends on your energy consumption needs and the capacity of the batteries."}},"22b8947a-5d93-4a5e-8610-0800bed72e27":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Which Is Better? An Off-Grid or an On-Grid Solar System?","answer":"Whether an on-grid or off-grid solar system is the best choice for you depends on your personal needs and where you live. Rural areas could benefit more from off-grid than on-grid, for instance, as their power supply tends to be less reliable or nonexistent. The biggest downfall of on-grid systems is that they can't protect you from grid power outages.

There is no one-size-fits-all approach.

The downside is that you must stay on top of energy generation and storage.
