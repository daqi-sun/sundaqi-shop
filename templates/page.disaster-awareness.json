But this is only an average! <\/p><p><\/p><p>The duration of a power outage ultimately depends on the cause. Day-to-day outages from a downed line or brief interruption in service may only last minutes. In a major event like a hurricane, power outages for individual homes or neighborhoods could last days or even weeks.<\/p>"}},"9defd531-c96b-4e1a-9c39-a5e26db264f1":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"What causes power outages?","answer":"<p>Power outages are incredibly varied and can stem from various issues within or outside human control. For example, municipal governments may plan rolling brownouts by a city or region to reduce overall energy use. An intentional outage may negatively impact residents and businesses in an area but is targeted, controlled, and typically short-term.<\/p><p><\/p><p>On the other hand, electrical grids can be interrupted without warning for several reasons. A car accident can take down an electrical pole and temporarily cause power to go out due to a downed line. A hurricane, tsunami, or fire could also damage large-scale electrical systems, leading to outages that can last long periods.  <\/p>"}},"6186d278-c2ef-4ef9-ae27-52a38ef88b36":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"What would happen if all power went out?","answer":"<p>The consequences could be deadly if all the power went out in a neighborhood or town. While many major institutions like hospitals have backup generators, not every business, home, and roadway will have reliable access to electricity. For example, traffic light systems may go down, making it difficult or dangerous to travel. In a large-scale outage, utility providers can take longer to restore all systems. <\/p>"}},"1047ad25-37c4-467d-a9a9-233b2827ae4a":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"Is a worldwide blackout possible?","answer":"<p>Some believe a solar storm could interrupt Earth's geomagnetic field and cause a worldwide blackout. While an event of this magnitude can happen, most scientists believe it is improbable. NASA's space weather forecasts monitor these solar storms to ensure a catastrophic event of this nature is not looming.<\/p><p>Setting aside a global catastrophe, it is even less likely a worldwide blackout would occur for one reason: not all grids are connected. A downed system in one city rarely impacts the grid in another area unless the same event affects both locations. But a global outage is unlikely to occur.<\/p>"}},"7fd71cea-99ca-48e2-aa78-79da77c04371":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"How long is food OK in the fridge without power?","answer":"<p>If the power goes out in your home for more than 4 hours, you should not consume the food in your refrigerator. To help food stay cold and safe to consume longer, do not open the fridge or freezer doors. <\/p>"}},"20fd90f4-6a91-4cc9-8aee-e5c865b0cd09":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"What do I need to survive with no power?","answer":"<p>According to the CDC, families should have an emergency kit with enough supplies to last at least three days without power. The kit should include nonperishable and ready-to-eat foods, prescription medications, first aid supplies, and battery-powered devices such as flashlights. Depending on your climate, you may need heating or cooling supplies such as extra blankets or battery-powered fans. <\/p>"}},"ad885b4d-4f51-41b8-beaf-9ff108865609":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"What should be unplugged during a power outage?","answer":"<p>While surge protectors typically prevent devices from damage during power restoration, it's wise to unplug as many devices and appliances as possible during an outage. <\/p>"}},"958be033-bde6-41c1-8359-a10e9022dcf6":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"What is the first thing you do when the power goes out?","answer":"<p>If you're at home when an outage hits, unplug devices and appliances, locate your emergency kit, and get ready to stay put until the utility provider restores power to your neighborhood.

Because these devices operate independently of the electrical grid, they will not be affected by a widespread outage. The EcoFlow DELTA 2 portable power station can keep the lights or WiFi running for over 30 hours during an outage. <\/p>"}},"b9b846e6-c026-4a2b-822a-344055e2a700":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"How can I survive a week-long power outage?","answer":"<p>A week-long power outage is no joke. Preparation is key. A backup power source, like the <a href=\"https:\/\/us.ecoflow.com\/pages\/delta-solar-generators\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">DELTA solar generator<\/span><\/a>, can make all the difference. In addition, make sure you have enough nonperishable food and water for your family, battery-powered flashlights and lanterns, and plenty of board games and books for entertainment.

A portable power station or generator can help keep your cell phone charged, so you can communicate as soon as calls go through again.<\/p>"}},"781e7727-1957-47f8-a99d-585a349f3ef7":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"How long can you run a generator continuously?","answer":"<p>Generators are convenient in an outage. But not all generators offer the same benefits when it comes to continuous usage. For example, gas generators should not run continuously for more than 12-18 hours due to the dangers of carbon monoxide emissions and the need to refuel. Solar generators, however, can run longer since they do not produce dangerous gases and can charge via solar panels even while in use. <\/p>"}},"1e887d17-5f25-4470-8b52-4bbab672efcc":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"Will solar panels work during a power outage?","answer":"<p>If your solar panels are grid-tied, they will be rendered ineffective, just like any electrical system connected to the grid during an outage. However, if you've hooked up your solar panels to a portable charging station or generator as part of a <a href=\"https:\/\/us.ecoflow.com\/pages\/home-ecosystem\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Smart Home Ecosystem<\/span><\/a>, they can continue to generate electricity as long as you have consistent access to sunlight. <\/p><p>Reliable and constant access to power is why solar generators are best for emergency home backup.
